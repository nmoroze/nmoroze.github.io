Hi! My name is Noah, and I'm currently an ML compiler engineer on the compute team at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/).
I also maintain [tclint](https://github.com/nmoroze/tclint), an open-source linter for the Tcl scripting language.

I've previously worked at two early-stage startups.
Most recently I was at [zeroRISC](https://zerorisc.com), where I worked on silicon manufacturing security.
Prior to this I worked on silicon design and emulation tools at [Zero ASIC](https://zeroasic.com).

I have a BS and MEng in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT.

If you're interested in the sort of stuff I work on, consider following me on [Github](https://github.com/nmoroze) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-moroze-715173a0/).
